					<b>The word "computer" in different languages</b>
					<br />
					English Language : Computer
					<br />
					Thai Language : คณิตกรณ์, คอมพิวเตอร์ (Transliteration)
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Definition of computer</b>
					<br />
					Computer means a device that uses mathematical methods to calculate and process results.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>What is computer</b>
					<br />
					A computer is a programmable tool or device designed to perform operations using mathematical methods. Computers can solve many problems. and able to work according to the needs of a wide range of human beings
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Where did the word computer originate from ?</b>
					<br />
					The word Computer comes from the Latin word Computare, which means counting or calculating, but in the present Computer refers to devices or tools that can perform various tasks. quickly replace the human
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>how the computer works</b>
					<br />
					Input --&gt; Processing --&gt; Output
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>The role of computers in daily life</b>
					<br />
					Today, computers have come into play in many fields. Our human life today is almost always associated with computers. From waking up to starting work each day. until bedtime Computers have been invented to be applied to a wide range of applications such as business, medicine, education, arts, entertainment, and industry.

					<b>Computer history</b>
					<br />
					- primitive man Humans counted numbers by using their fingers, branches, stones and scribbles on the ground or cave walls. and developed into simple calculations such as addition, subtraction, etc.
					<br />
					- 3,000 years BC ancient babylonians Created a device for calculating and taking notes using stones and clay attached to a rope attached to a rectangular wooden frame.
					<br />
					- 2000 years BC The Chinese have created an abacus.
					<br />
					- John Napier created Napire's Bone.
					<br />
					- 1642 Blaise Pascal created the Pascal Calculator.
					<br />
					- 1633 William Oughtred created the Slide Rule.
					<br />
					- 1671 Gottfried Wilhelm Leinitz ได้สร้างเครื่อง Leibnitz Calculating Machine
					<br />
					- 1823 Charles Babbage builds the Difference Engine.
					<br />
					- Charles Babbage built the Analytical Engine and was the father of computing.
					<br />
					- Ada Augusta Byron was the world's first programmer.
					<br />
					- 1887 Dr. Herman Hollerith creates Hollerith Card punching cards and Hollerith punch card tools, later establishing IBM (International Business Machines Corporation).
					<br />
					- 1937 Professor Hovard Aiken created the ASCC (Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Mark I) as an electro mechanical device.
					<br />
					- 1941 John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert create the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical And Calculator), the world's first electronic computer.
					<br />
					- Dr. John Von Neumann built the EDVAC, the world's first stored program computer.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Computer evolution</b>
					<br />
					- The First Generation, 1944 - 1958, the era of Vacuum Tubes
					<br />
					Computers use vacuum tubes as the main component. It uses high power, so there is a problem with heating. Order using machine language (Machine Code or Machine Language) computers are large. Computers of this era include ASCC (Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Mark I), ENIAC (Electronic Numerical And Calculator), EDVAC, IBM 650, UNIVAC I, etc.
					<br />
					- The Second Generation, 1959 - 1964, Transistor
					<br />
					Computers use transistors as the main component. Can operate using high-level languages such as FORTRAN (Formula Translation), BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), COBAL (Common Business Oriented), etc. Some machines have adopted a magnetic ring (Magnetic Core) is used as a component. Examples of computers in this era are IBM 1401, IBM 7000, CD 3600, etc.
					<br />
					- The Third Generation, 1964 - 1974, the era of integrated circuits (IC: Integrated Circuits).
					<br />
					Computers in this era will use integrated circuits (IC: Integrated Circuit) as the main component. which is crystalline silicon that inside can be made into a transistor And other components that can be combined into circuits for performing various tasks by bringing in the IC to create the CPU, Memory and other components of the computer. Which computers in this era include IBM 360, UNIVAC 9400, etc.
					<br />
					- The Fourth Generation Computer, 1975, the era of large-scale integrated circuits (LSI: Large Scale Integrated Circuits).
					<br />
					In this era, small electronic devices were created as silicon crystals that consisted of enormous number of sub-circuits, as if combining many ICs, called large-scale integrated circuits (LSI: Large Scale Integrated Circuits). New LSIs for use as CPUs until developed into very high-capacity integrated circuits (VLSI: Very Large Scale Integration or Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits) such as Micro Processors. Computers in this era include IBM 370, IBM 4311, NEC 300, IBM/PC and many others
					<br />
					- The Fifth Generation Computer, The era of very large integrated circuits.
					<br />
					An agency was established to find a way to develop computers. VLSI has been developed to be more efficient, e.g. for CPU cores. And computers in this era are smaller and more efficient. There have been experiments and research to find out how to make computers as intelligent as humans, such as artificial intelligence (AI: Artificial Intelligence), etc., and have put various systems in the same chip (SoC: System on Chip) most devices. Able to connect to the Internet(IoT : Internet of Thing) and have AI to help manage
					<br />
					- The Sixth Generation Computer
					<br />
					Because in order to increase the performance of the computer, the size of the transistor must be reduced. and increase the number of transistors in the processor chip But humans can't produce smaller than the present. Therefore, a quantum computer was created.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Characteristics of computer circuits in different eras</b>
					<br />
					- 1st generation vacuum tube circuit (Vacuum Tube)
					<br />
					- 2nd Generation Transistor Circuits
					<br />
					- Third Generation Integrated Circuits (IC : Integrated Circuits)
					<br />
					- 4th generation chips integrated circuits are more complex than before.
					<br />
					- 5th era: System on Chip (Soc: System on Chip) Circuits in a chip combine things into a single chip and become more complex than before.
					<br />
					- 6th era quantum chips (Quantum Chip) circuits using quantum chips.
					<br />
